            <p>An ulcer is a painful sore that is slow to heal and sometimes recurs. Ulcers aren’t uncommon. Why they appear and their corresponding symptoms typically depend on their underlying causes.</p>
            <p>Ulcers can appear anywhere in or on your body, from the lining in your stomach to the outer layer of your skin.</p>
            <p>Sometimes ulcers disappear on their own. Other times they require medical treatment to prevent serious complications.</p>

        <span style="line-height: auto;">  
          <p class="w3-text-red" style="font-size: 25px;"><b>DIFFERENT TYPES OF ULCERS</b></p>
            <p>
              There are a few types of ulcers, including:<br>- arterial ulcers<br>- venous ulcers<br>- mouth ulcers<br>- genital ulcers
            </p>
        </span>
          <p class="w3-text-black" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Arterial ulcers</b></p>
          <p style="line-height: 2.0;">
            <img src="Arterial ulcers 1.jpg" width="50%"><img src="arterial-ulcer-characteristics.jpg" width="50%">
            <p><b>Arterial (ischemic) ulcers</b> are open sores that primarily develop on the smaller side of arterioles and capillaries, most often around the outer side of your ankle, feet, toes, and heels.</p>
            <p>Arterial ulcers develop from damage to the arteries due to a lack of blood flow to the tissue. Arterial ulcers are also sometimes found in the gut in individuals who are ill and have poor blood pressure in general.</p>
            <p>These forms of ulcers can take months to heal and require proper treatment to prevent infection and further complications.</p>
            <p>Arterial ulcers have a “punched out” appearance accompanied by a number of symptoms, including:</p>
            <p class="w3-text-deep-purple w3-hover-text-lime">- red, yellow, or black sores<br>- hairless skin<br>- leg pain<br>- no bleeding<br>- affected area cool to the touch from minimal blood circulation.</p>
            <p>Treatment for arterial ulcers depends on the underlying cause. Primary treatment includes restoring blood circulation to the affected area.</p>
            <p>While antibiotics may help reduce symptoms, your doctor may recommend surgery to increase blood flow to your tissues and organs. In more severe circumstances, your doctor may recommend amputation.</p>
          </p>

          <p class="w3-text-black" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Venous ulcers</b></p>
          <p style="line-height: 2.0;">
            <img src="Variceal-ulcers.jpg" width="50%"><img src="Venous-Ulcers.jpg" width="50%">
            <p><b>Venous ulcers</b> — the most common type of leg ulcers — are open wounds that often form on your leg, below your knee, and on the inner area of your ankle. They typically develop from damage to your veins caused by insufficient blood flow back to your heart.</p>
            <p>In some cases, venous ulcers cause little to no pain unless they’re infected. Other cases of this condition can be very painful.</p>
            <p>Venous ulceration is not always in the gaiter region. It can be situated directly downstream of hidden (A) and more obvious varicose veins (B). These are termed varicose/variceal ulcers. Note the surrounding lipodermatosclerosis which is pathognomonic for venous ulceration</p>
            <p>Other symptoms you may experience include:</p>
            <p>- inflammation<br>
            - swelling<br>
            - itchy skin<br>
            - scabbing<br>
            - discharge</p>
            <p>Venous ulcers can take months to fully heal. In rare cases, they may never heal. Treatment focuses on improving flow to the affected area. Antibiotics can help prevent infection and reduce symptoms, but they aren’t enough to heal venous ulcers.</p>
            <p>Alongside medication, your doctor may recommend surgery or compression therapy to increase blood flow.</p>
          </p>

          <p class="w3-text-black" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Peptic ulcers</b></p>
          <p style="line-height: 2.0;">
            <img src="peptic U.jpg" width="50%"><img src="another ulcer.jpeg" width="50%">
            <p><b>Peptic ulcers</b> are sores or wounds that can develop on:</p>
            <p>- the inside lining of your stomach<br>
            - the upper portion of your small intestine<br>
            - your esophagus</p>
            <p>They form when digestive juices damage the walls of your stomach or intestine. These ulcers <b>are quite common.</b></p>
            <p>Peptic ulcers are most often caused by inflammation after contracting Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria or through long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).</p>
            <p>There are <b>two types</b> of peptic ulcers:</p>
            <p>- <b>gastric ulcers</b>, or ulcers that develop in the stomach lining<br>
            - duodenal ulcers, or ulcers that develop in the duodenum (small intestine)</p>
            <p>The most common symptom of this condition is a burning sensation.<br>Other symptoms may include:</p>

            <p>- <b>bloating</b> or the feeling of being full<br>
            - belching<br>
            - heartburn<br>
            - nausea<br>
            - vomiting<br>
            - unexplained weight loss<br>
            - chest pain</p>
            <p>Treatment depends on the underlying cause of your ulcer. If you have an H. pylori infection, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to kill the harmful bacteria.</p>
            <p>For the majority of peptic ulcer cases, acid-lowering medication regimens are generally prescribed to help protect the mucosal lining from stomach acid so it has time to heal.</p>
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-black" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Mouth ulcers</b></p>
          <p style="line-height: 2.0;">
            <img src="mouth ulcer 4.png" width="50%"><img src="mouth ulcer 1.jpg" width="50%">
            <p><b>Mouth ulcers</b> are small sores or lesions that develop in your mouth or the base of your gums. They’re commonly known as canker sores.</p>
            <p>These ulcers are triggered by a number of causes, including:</p>
            <p class="w3-text-green">- stress<br>
            - hormonal changes<br>
            - vitamin deficiencies<br>
            - bacterial infection<br>
            - diseases</p>
            <p>Mouth ulcers are common and often go away within 2 weeks. They can be uncomfortable but shouldn’t cause significant pain. If a mouth ulcer is extremely painful or doesn’t go away within 2 weeks, seek immediate medical attention.</p>
            <p>Minor mouth ulcers appear as small, round ulcers that leave no scarring. In more severe cases, they can develop into larger and deeper wounds. Other serious symptoms associated with this type of ulcer may include:</p>
            <p>- unusually slow healing (lasting longer than 3 weeks)<br>
              - ulcers that extend to your lips<br>
              - issues eating or drinking<br>
              - <b>fever<br>
              - diarrhea</b>
            </p>
            <p>Mouth ulcers often go away on their own without treatment. If they become painful, your doctor or dentist may prescribe an antimicrobial mouthwash or ointment to reduce your discomfort.</p>
            <p>If your condition is the result of a more serious infection, seek medical attention to receive the best treatment.</p>
          </p>
        <p class="w3-text-black" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Genital ulcers</b></p>

            <img src="GUD2.png" width="50%" height="auto"><img src="GUD3.png" width="50%">

            <p>Genital ulcers are sores that develop on genital areas, including the penis, vagina, anus, or surrounding areas. They are usually caused by <b>sexually transmitted infections (STIs)</b>, but genital ulcers can also be triggered by trauma, inflammatory diseases, or even, in some cases, an <b>Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) infection</b>.</p>
            <p>In addition to sores, symptoms that may accompany genital ulcers include:</p>
            <p>
              - rash or bumps in the affected area<br>
              - pain or itching<br>
              - <b>swollen glands in the groin area</b><br>
              - fever
            </p>
            <p>Similar to other types of ulcers, treatment depends on the underlying cause of your condition. In some cases, these sores will go away on their own. If diagnosed with an STI, your doctor may prescribe antiviral or antibiotic medication or ointment. If you feel you’ve been exposed to an STI, seek immediate medical attention.</p>

          <span class="w3-text-right">
            <img src="Stomach Pains.jpeg" width="20%" height="30%">
            <p><b>The most common symptom</b> of a peptic ulcer is stomach pain. Often, the pain starts in the center of your stomach and can travel up to your throat or seemingly down your back. This pain can last for a few minutes to a few hours and is usually only temporarily eased by antacids.</p>
            <p>You may also feel ill if you have a stomach ulcer and may lose weight.</p>
            <p><b>Serious complications</b> of peptic ulcers include:</p>
            <p>
              - vomiting blood<br>
              - passing dark, tarry stools<br>
              - a sudden, sharp pain in your stomach that only gets worse, not better
            </p>
            <p>There is no difference between stomach ulcer symptoms in men versus stomach ulcer symptoms in women; however, <b>men are typically more predisposed</b> to developing these types of ulcers, according to the National Health Service (NHS).</p>

        <div style="line-height: 2.0;">
          <p class="w3-text-red" style="font-size: 25px;"><b>Do ulcers go away?</b></p>

            <p>Most ulcers, no matter where they are on the body, are caused by underlying issues. Therefore, the answer to “do ulcers go away?” is directly related to how effective the treatment is for the underlying health issue.</p>
            <p>Some ulcers, like peptic and genital ulcers, will go away but then reappear, even with treatment. If you find yourself dealing with chronic ulcers and haven’t yet pinned down a cause, it’s important to talk with your doctor immediately.</p>
        
        </div>

        <div style="line-height: 2.0;">
          <p class="w3-text-red" style="font-size: 25px;"><b>How long does it take for ulcers to heal?</b></p>

            <p>The length of time it takes for your ulcer to heal depends on the type, as well as the severity of the ulcer itself.</p>
            <p>For many <b>peptic ulcers</b>, the <b>healing time</b> is around a month or so with treatment.</p>
            <p><b>Arterial ulcers</b> can take several months to heal, or may not even heal at all.</p>
            <p>With compression therapy, venous ulcers can be healed in a few months, although some may not heal at all.</p>
            <p><b>Mouth ulcers</b>, or canker sores, can take anywhere from <b>a week to 4 weeks</b> to heal with treatment. However, many people have reoccurring mouth ulcers.</p>
            <p>The amount of time it takes to heal genital ulcers really depends on what is causing them. For example, individuals living with genital herpes, which is a sexually transmitted disease, can treat their ulcers but cannot cure them, so they may periodically reappear.</p>
            <p>Most ulcers will go away faster with the proper treatment.</p>

          <p>"Thank you for the discovery of VANTACIN +. My husband and i have been suffering from Gonorrhea and i got 5 bottle for myself and for him. We were both losing it but I told him to use it just 30 days. Upon completion, we went to the hospital for a test. The test showed that we had no traces of infections in us. I'm glad I took action"</p>

I used to have burning sensations around my chest, I do regurgitate and also experience Indigestion. I've been battling this for years and I've taken lots of products but to no avail. I used this product for 3 months and all i can say is I'm grateful to God".</p>

        <p>"If I had stumbled upon this since a long time, maybe I wouldn't have spent more on something that doesn't work. In about 3 weeks of taking GIREED, my story was never the same. However, I had the patiece of waiting to finish it to also observe the aftermath. Some, after using, It comes back but this I can sy has cured me finally and I've been eating and dinning. I'm so happy. Thank you."</p>

        <p>"A concerned friend saw this online and decided to get it for me. Ideally, I wouldn't get it if it was me but I had to use it because I don't want him to waste his money. I was encouraged when a meal plan and usage was sent to me. I was been followed-up during the time I was using it and even had to be courageous in using it when I didn't get any result. I finished it and i didn't feel any more symptom. When I went for endoscopy, it appeared my ulcer has been healed. Thank you for this great dicovery".</p>
